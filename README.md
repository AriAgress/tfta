# Team Fight Tactics Performance Tracker

TFTA is a React application used for tracking your performance on team fight tactics. I compiled data, ran functions through them, to create averages on your previous 10 games.

## Installation

- Clone repo to client.
- Npm i in server.
- Npm i in client.
- Create .env file.
- Log onto "https://developer.riotgames.com/" to generate an API key.
- Plug it into your .env file as such "API_KEY=(your API key)"

## Usage

Now you can input anyone's Riot screen name into the search bar and generate the stats on their last 10 games, including some basic information on their profile.
